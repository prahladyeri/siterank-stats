- [fiverr.com](https://www.fiverr.com) - A good freelance site in its own niche for quick and short-term jobs with limited budgets. Fiverr is different from typical platforms where the client posts a requirement and many freelancers bid on that like a tender system. [Rank: 126, Tags: jobs,work]
- [upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com) - Upwork is like the "bread and butter" for freelance programmers, its history goes back all the way to the merging of two popular platforms called **eLance** and **oDesk**. [Rank: 305, Tags: jobs,work]
- [guru.com](https://www.guru.com) - Yet another freelance portal, maybe not as good as Upwork/Fiverr, but still better than Freelancer.com. [Rank: 3455, Tags: jobs,work]
- [toptal.com](https://www.toptal.com) - Toptal is a global network of top software engineers and designers with a hiring rate of less than 3%. Toptal works with clients to understand their project/team needs and custom-matches them with pre-screened developers and designers who join their teams on a full-time, part-time, or hourly basis. [Rank: 5065, Tags: jobs,work]
- [truelancer.com](https://www.truelancer.com) - Yet another freelance platform, this one is based in India. [Rank: 7471, Tags: jobs,work]
- [fivesquid.com](https://www.fivesquid.com) - Its the British version of Fiverr, only difference is that you get paid in British Pounds (GBP) instead of USD. Also, the website lacks some features compared to Fiverr (such as the ability to send a customized offer in the free membership plan, read various statistics about your gigs, etc). [Rank: 22716, Tags: jobs,work]
- [golance.com](https://golance.com) - Joined this site recently, seems very promising from what I've heard on Reddit, personally, I'm yet to land on a project here. [Rank: 85866, Tags: jobs,work]
