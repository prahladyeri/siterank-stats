- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - Comprehensive curriculum and large number of programming courses to choose from. No free certificates though.
	[Rank: 219, Tags: it courses]
- [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu) - One of the best online resource to get learning content. However, you won't get any certificates on course completion.
	[Rank: 607, Tags: it courses]
- [edx.org](https://courses.edx.org/) - Yet another MOOC. They used to offer free certificates until few years ago but no longer now.
	[Rank: 932, Tags: it courses]
- [Stanford Online](http://online.stanford.edu/) - Another great university that provisions learning content through the online channel. Again, no certificates, but still great course content.
	[Rank: 1372, Tags: it courses]
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - Fun and gamified way of learning web development. You can even try this if you already are a programmer and just want to exercise your coding muscles.
	[Rank: 1594, Tags: it courses]
- [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com) - My personal favorite! They have a mind blowing quiz/gamified way of teaching programming and what's more, they provide free online/PDF certificates on successful completion too!

- [Saylor Academy](https://learn.saylor.org) - Non profit Australian Academy offering various CS courses. Highly recommended!
	[Rank: 29402, Tags: it courses]
- [Open2Study](https://www.open2study.com) - Launched in April 2013 by a [collaboration of several Australian universities](http://www.thegoodmooc.com/2013/06/a-review-of-open2study.html). The number of programming specific courses is currently small, but should grow in future considering that they are more leaning towards career-oriented than core academic courses.
